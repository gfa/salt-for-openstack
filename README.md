Salt States for OpenStack
========================


This very simple states can configure OpenStack using salt, they can configure keystone, glance, nova and neutron.
tested on ubuntu and debian, icehouse, juno and kilo releases.

I may add another states later when I need them as I use this repo to drive my testing, my production repo gets frequent merges from this repo.

Directories

pillar:

is the *pillar_roots*


states:

is the *file_roots*


states/cloud:
openstack states


after installing all the software and configurations, a bunch of files on the root user homedir will be created they will create network, images, etc.
I'm in the process to move those files to salt modules which will do the same. I plan to use https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/openstack-formula

NOTES
---

- For simplicity only *base* environment is configured.

- If you are looking for formulas, like Puppet modules for OpenStack, you won't find them here.
I don't like complex formulas and I don't use them as I found them hard to explain or follow.
I use simple state files where pkgs are installed, config files are generated and services are enabled/started/restarted/reload

- There are keys in the repo, I plan to move them to pillar then to a private location, but as I don't use this directly on production it may take a while.
- Same with pillar values, I don't consider them private.
- Many state files call pillar to get the values and them pass it to template config files, that's an extra round trip. When I first did it I didn't know (or wasn't it possible) for a template call a pillar by itself.
New states i've added call the pillar from the template files, but I'm too lazy to modify the old ones.
- think of 'node_type' grain as *role*
